# Softgames Pixi Assignment

Pixi.js + TypeScript assignment implementing three mini-scenes:

- **Ace of Shadows**: card–based puzzle with stacks and card movement rules.
- **Magic Words**: dialogue system backed by an HTTP API and emoji/text rendering.
- **Phoenix Flame**: particle-based fire effect using Pixi and GSAP-style timing.

### Setup

- **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

- **Run dev server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

- **Build for production**

```bash
npm run build
```

### GitHub Pages deployment (CI/CD)

This repo is configured to deploy to **GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions**, mirroring the setup from the `pixelated-slot-game` project.

- **Workflow file**: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
- **Build output**: Vite builds into the `dist/` directory, which is uploaded as the Pages artifact.
- **Branch used for deployment**: `main`

To trigger a deployment:

1. Commit your changes on `development` (or feature branches) and push.
2. Merge your changes into `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development

   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge development
   git push origin main
   ```

3. Pushing to `main` starts the **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow, which:
   - Installs dependencies (`npm ci`)
   - Runs `npm run build`
   - Uploads `dist/` and deploys it to the `github-pages` environment using `actions/deploy-pages`.

Make sure your repository’s **Settings → Pages** is configured to use **GitHub Actions** as the source.
